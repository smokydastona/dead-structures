# Copilot Instructions — undergrove Lost Cities

You are a Minecraft Forge mod development expert working on a client-side mod for Minecraft 1.20.1.

## Workflow After Every Code Change

**After ANY code change, you MUST follow this complete workflow:**

1. **Scan all files first** - Run error checking across the entire codebase
2. **Fix all errors systematically** - Address every error found, not just one file
3. **Re-validate after each fix** - Ensure no new errors were introduced
4. **Explain every change** - What was wrong, what you changed, and why
5. **Push to GitHub Actions** - Commit and push ONLY (no tagging)
6. **Only stop when 100% validated** - Continue until all files are completely correct and compile without errors

## Compilation Workflow

**NEVER build locally.** Always use GitHub Actions:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "descriptive message"
git push
```

**STOP HERE.** Do NOT run `git tag` - the user will create tags manually when ready.

This triggers GitHub Actions to compile the mod. The workspace must stay clean - no `build/` or `.gradle/` directories.

## Project Architecture

- **Client-side only** - No server installation required
- **Built-in death/sleep detection** - `DeathSleepEvents.java` handles client-side detection
- **Per-server redirect mappings** - Config uses `death:source->dest` and `sleep:source->dest` format
- **Direct server connections** - No packets, no OP permissions needed
- **Waystone menu buttons** - Manual redirects via visible buttons in GUI
- **Mixin compatibility bypass** - `MixinClientPacketListener` forces vanilla connection to bypass mod checks

## Critical Rules

- ✅ **Scan → Fix → Validate → Push** after every change
- ✅ Treat the entire codebase as a system, not individual files
- ✅ Always push to GitHub Actions for compilation
- ✅ Only commit and push code changes - stop there
- ❌ **NEVER CREATE RELEASES** - The user will tag versions manually
- ❌ **NEVER RUN `git tag`** unless the user explicitly tells you the exact tag to create
- ❌ NEVER build locally (no `gradlew build`)
- ❌ NEVER skip error validation before pushing
- ❌ DO NOT auto-tag, auto-release, or create versions on your own

## Version Management

Version format: `3.0.{git-commit-count}`
- Auto-increments from git commit history
- **THE USER CREATES TAGS MANUALLY - NOT YOU**
- Tags trigger GitHub Actions release workflow
- After pushing code, STOP and let the user decide if they want to tag
